# Riva Utilities for NeMo and TAO - SmartCow

## [Riva](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva)

NVIDIA® Riva is a GPU-accelerated SDK for building Speech AI applications that are customized for your use case and deliver real-time performance. This repo is to support Riva on Embedded Devices - specifically [Smartcow](https://smartcow.ai/)'s [Apollo](https://apollo.smartcow.ai/) - an Audio Visual Engineering kit.

## [NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo)

NVIDIA NeMo is a conversational AI toolkit built for researchers working on automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). The primary objective of NeMo is to help researchers from industry and academia to reuse prior work (code and pretrained models) and make it easier to create new conversational AI models.


## [TAO](https://developer.nvidia.com/tao-toolkit)

Creating an AI/machine learning model from scratch requires mountains of data and an army of data scientists. Now, you can speed up the model development process with transfer learning —a popular technique that extracts learned features from an existing neural network model to a new customized one.

The NVIDIA TAO Toolkit, built on TensorFlow and PyTorch, is a low-code version of the NVIDIA TAO framework that accelerates the model training process by abstracting away the AI/deep learning framework complexity. The TAO Toolkit lets you use the power of transfer learning to fine-tune NVIDIA pretrained models with your own data and optimize for inference—without AI expertise or large training datasets.
